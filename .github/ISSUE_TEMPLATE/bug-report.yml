    description: |
      Please provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is.

      If relevant, add a minimal example so that we can reproduce the error by running the code. It is very important for the snippet to be as succinct (minimal) as possible, so please take time to trim down any irrelevant code to help us debug efficiently.
      Your example should be fully self-contained and not rely on any artifact that should be downloaded.
      For example:

      ```
      # All necessary imports at the beginning
      
      ```

      # Sample code to reproduce the problem
      ```

      ```
      The error message you got, with the full traceback.
